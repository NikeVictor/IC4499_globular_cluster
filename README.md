# IC4499_globular_cluster
Isochrone Fitting of the IC 4499 Globular Cluster to determine the age of the universe.
This project focuses on the isochrone fitting of the IC 4499 globular cluster to determine its age, metallicity, and distance modulus. The study utilizes photometric data from the GAIA and HST/ACS WFC (Vega) observatory datasets, combined with theoretical isochrones from the DSED stellar model.
